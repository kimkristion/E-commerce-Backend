# E-commerce Backend
## Introduction
Welcome to my ecommerce backend code. This code utilizes the Express.js API and is configured to interact with a MySQL database using Sequelize. It allows users to employ CRUD methods for managing products, categories, and tags on an ecommerce website.

## Description
- When seeking inspiration for this code, I explored prevalent applications in today's market. Motivated by the prospect of acquiring new skills, I undertook the challenge of backend development for a virtual store.
- This application was developed using Express.js, Sequalize, and MYSQL. I utilized an ORM framework to handle all angles of database relations, this allowed for a more efficient development process.
- My application demonstrations my ability to use Express to configure Sequelize for MYSQL databases. Through this relationship, I was able to execute CRUD methods on a server, allowing for managing and manipulating data.
- Throughout the development process of this application, I delved deeper into documentation of sequalize and MYSQL, gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between them.
